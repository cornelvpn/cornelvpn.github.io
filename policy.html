                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>Cornel VPN uses the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
                <p><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To provide you with the core functionality of Cornel VPN, such as establishing secure VPN connections, routing your traffic through our servers, and ensuring uninterrupted service.</p>
                <p><strong>Improvement and Optimization:</strong> To analyze usage patterns, troubleshoot technical issues, and improve the performance, reliability, and features of Cornel VPN. For example, we may use crash logs to fix bugs or usage data to optimize server capacity.</p>

                <p><strong>Security:</strong> To enhance the security of Cornel VPN by detecting and preventing abuse, fraud, or unauthorized access to our systems. This includes monitoring for suspicious activity and maintaining the integrity of our network.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>Cornel VPN takes the security of your information seriously and employs robust measures to protect it. We use industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) to secure your data in transit between your device and our servers. Our servers are hosted in secure facilities with access controls and monitoring to prevent unauthorized entry.</p>
                <p>We also implement internal policies and technical safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits, to protect your data from loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the event of a data breach, Cornel VPN will notify affected users as required by applicable laws.</p>
